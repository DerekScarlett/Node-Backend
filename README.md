# node-backend

This project uses node.js to host our server to allow the user to scroll through 3 html files that t=which each does a different thing.
The first one generates a random number everytime you click. the secod uses an API that I created in our server to dring information about dreads and the third html file is just a troll when you click on te button then you can start all over.

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js

First I had to use node to host the server that i built in my backend.js file. After I hosted the the site the i used a javascript click function the generate a random number and append it to the DOM. Also everytime you click on the button it appends a different random nuber. The second html file acces a api that I built in the backend.js it resquest a response from my api then appends that response to the DOM.The last is me hidding a message then using javascript you append that message to the DOM after clicking. Each page also has a button tht direct the user to the next page.

Optimizations
If I was to go back and work on this some more I would go back and addd more javscript trick to each page to make them more interactive with the user. Also I would add more style to the last html file to make it more appealing.

Lessons Learned:
I learned that useing node servers causes you to really under paths so that node can pull your files and build your website. Even links need to be included in you server or they wont work .
